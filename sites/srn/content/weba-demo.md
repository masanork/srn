# Why Web/A?

Conventional archival formats like PDF/A are excellent for visual preservation, but they often fail when it comes to **machine readability**. 

In the modern world, documents are no longer just for human eyes. They are processed by AI, indexed by search engines, and integrated into large-scale databases.

## Key Features of this Document

1.  **Machine-Readable Layer**: Open the source code of this page to find the `<script type="application/ld+json">` tag. It contains structured data that any machine can easily parse.
2.  **Long-Term Accessibility**: Using standard HTML/CSS means this document will remain readable as long as web browsers exist.
3.  **Efficiency**: The fonts used in this document are dynamically subsetted, including only the characters used on this page, resulting in a tiny file size without sacrificing beautiful typography.

## Example Data Extraction

A machine parsing this document can immediately determine:
- **Date**: 2024-12-24
- **Format**: Web/A
- **Status**: Proposal

## Conclusion

Web/A is not just a format; it's a philosophy of "Data First, Visuals Built-in".
